# GROMACS .xvg Plotting Script

This is Python script to automate the plotting of `.xvg` files generated by GROMACS, with proper labeling, dynamic time unit detection, and colorful plots. This script reads data from `.xvg` files, assigns meaningful labels based on file contents, and saves the plots as `.png` images.

## Features

- **Automatic Axis Labeling**: Labels for y-axis based on common GROMACS output keywords (e.g., Potential, RMSD, Density).
- **Time Unit Detection**: Detects and uses the appropriate time unit (e.g., `ps`, `ns`, `fs`) from each `.xvg` file header.
- **Colorful Plots**: Randomized colors for each plot line to distinguish different files.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes all `.xvg` files in the folder, creating individual plot images for each file.

## Requirements

- **Python 3**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
